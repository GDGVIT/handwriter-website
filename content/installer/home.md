HandWriter can be installed on Windows and macOS using installers:
* [Download Windows installer](https://github.com/SaurusXI/HandwritingParser/releases/download/1.0.0/Windows.Installer.zip)
* [Download macOS installer](https://github.com/SaurusXI/HandwritingParser/releases/download/1.0.0/macOS.dmg.zip)

# Installing on Linux
An installation script has been provided that takes care of everything for you. It adds HandWriter to your package manager for automatic updates. It is always a good idea to inspect a shell script before executing it - you can do so once the script is downloaded via `curl` or `wget`. Linux installation steps are detailed here -
* [Install using script](/installer/linux/) 

If you would rather install everything manually, steps to do so can be found here -
* [Install manually](/installer/manual_install/)
